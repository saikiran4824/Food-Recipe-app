## üß† State Management
---

Global State:
Managed using Redux Toolkit, especially for managing the favorites list and UI state (e.g., modals or filters).

Async State & Caching:
API data is managed using React Query, which offers out-of-the-box caching, retry logic, stale time, and background updates.

Local State:
Controlled using useState or useReducer for form inputs and component-specific interactions.
